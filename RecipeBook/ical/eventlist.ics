SUMMARY:Lee Friedlander: The Cray Photographs
UID:events_stanford_edu_35019
DESCRIPTION:<p>In 1986 Cray Research\, Inc.&#160\;invited American master
  photographer Lee Friedlander (b. 1934) to create a photo-illustrated bo
 ok commemorating the company&#8217\;s 15th anniversary. Friedlander took
  these photographs at Cray Research\, Inc.\, Chippewa Falls\, Wisconsin\
 , birthplace of the Cray-1 supercomputer&#8212\;then the fastest compute
 r in the world. This extraordinary set of 79 vintage photographs is one 
 of the most recent partial and promised gifts to the Cantor Arts Center\
 , made by Michael J. Levinthal\, BS &#8217\;76\, MS &#8217\;77\, MBA &#8
 217\;81.</p>\n<p>This commission built on past projects in which Friedla
 nder photographed people working on factory assembly lines and in data-e
 ntry centers. Each of our newly acquired photographs of a Cray technicia
 n is both intimate and detached\, taken at close proximity while the wor
 ker labored at a complex manual task. The series also features images of
  the town of Chippewa Falls\, Wisconsin\, where the company was located\
 , and its surrounding landscape.&#160\;</p>\n<p>Many of the workers who 
 built these machines were women whom Seymour Cray\, Cray Research&#8217\
 ;s founder\, selected for their talents as crafters. The result was a la
 ndmark visual record documenting the assembly of this awe-inspiring supe
 rcomputer and the people who made it. These photos formed part of a comm
 emorative book given to all Cray employees.</p>\n<p>This exhibition invo
 lves collaboration with various members of the Stanford community. A vid
 eo made by recent Stanford alumni about the legacy of Cray will be on vi
 ew in the gallery.</p>

SUMMARY:Janet Gyatso: "Looking for the Human: Buddhism and Medicine in Ti

UID:events_stanford_edu_33619
DESCRIPTION:<p>Medicine and Buddhism have had a long history of interacti
 on and mutual influence in Asia. Tibetan medicine preserves a large arch
 ive of writing on the theoretical foundations of knowledge of the body a
 nd professional medical ethics\, along with one as one stunning and high
 ly detailed illustrated encyclopedia. &#160\;This material displays the 
 ways the medicine drew upon religious thought and practice but also reac
 hed beyond Buddhism for new ways of considering human embodiment on its 
 own terms and in light of everyday realities.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaker's 
 Bio<br /></strong><br />Janet Gyatso is a specialist in Buddhist studies
  with concentration on Tibetan cultural history. Her books include<em>Be
 ing Human in a Buddhist World: An Intellectual History of Medicine in Ea
 rly Modern Tibet</em>&#160\;(in press)\;&#160\;<em>Apparitions of the Se
 lf: The Secret Autobiographies of a Tibetan Visionary</em>\;&#160\;<em>I
 n the Mirror of Memory: Reflections on Mindfulness and Remembrance in In
 dian and Tibetan Buddhism</em>\; and&#160\;<em>Women of Tibet</em>. Her 
 recent work has focused on the conjunctions and disjunctures between rel
 igious and scientific epistemologies in Tibetan medicine in light of cul
 tural and political shifts in the early modern period. She has also been
  writing on sex and gender in medicine and in Buddhist monasticism\, and
  on the current female ordination movement in Buddhism. Previous topics 
 of her scholarship have included visionary revelation in Buddhism\; line
 age\, memory\, and authorship\; the philosophy of experience\; and autob
 iographical writing in Tibet. Gyatso was president of the International 
 Association of Tibetan Studies from 2000 to 2006\, and co-chair of the B
 uddhism Section of the American Academy of Religion from 2004 to 2010. S
 he teaches lecture courses and advanced seminars on Buddhist history\, r
 itual\, and ideas\, and on Tibetan literary practices and religious hist
 ory.</p>\n<p>Presented by the Evans-Wentz Lectureship and the Tibetan St

SUMMARY:China and Africa: Are there Lessons for Development?
UID:events_stanford_edu_35293
DESCRIPTION:<p>The lost decades for China in the 1950s\, 1960s and 1970s 
 look remarkably like the lost decades of Africa in the 1980s and 1990s. 
 Poor land rights\, weak incentives\, incomplete markets and inappropriat
 e investment portfolios. However\, China burst out of its stagnation in 
 the 1980s and has enjoyed three decades of remarkable growth. In this ta
 lk Rozelle examines the record of the development of China&#8217\;s food
  economy and identifies the policies that helped generate the growth and
  transformation of agriculture. Incentives\, markets and strategic inves
 tments by the state were key. Equally important\, however\, is what the 
 state did not do. Policies that worked and those that failed (or those t
 hat were ignored) are addressed. Most importantly\, Rozelle tries to tak
 e an objective\, nuanced look at the lessons that might be learned and t
 hose that are not relevant for Africa. Many parts of Africa have experie
 nced positive growth during the past decade. Rozelle examines if there a
 re any lessons that might be helpful in turning ten positive years into 
 several more decades of transformation.</p>\n<p>Speakers:</p>\n<p><stron

 e Theodor Herzl opened the first Zionist Congress in 1897\, the movement
  he claimed to have founded was already more than two decades old. Herzl
 &#8217\;s heroic debut on the world stage has cast a long shadow over th
 e actual beginnings of Zionism in late imperial Russia\, the place where
  Herzl found his most enthusiastic and loyal followers as well as his mo
 st serious and committed rivals. Absorbed into the history of Russian ra
 dicalism\, the Zionist turn in Russian-Jewish politics has been conventi
 onally ascribed to the collapse of Jewish liberal aspirations for civic 
 integration and religious reform under the pressure of pogrom violence a
 nd government persecution. In this paper\, Professor Litvak assesses the
  cogency of this explanation. Tracing the cultural genealogy of the Zion
 ist turn to the nineteenth-century conflict between the study house and 
 the synagogue\, she contests the widely held view that the nationalist t
 urn in Russian-Jewish history signifies the failure of the Jewish Enligh
 tenment and argues that the creation of the Zionist movement in Russia r
 epresents the triumph of Jewish Romanticism.</p>\n<p>&#160\;</p>\n<p>A g

 f <em>Conscription and the Search for Modern Russian Jewry</em> (Indiana
  UP\, 2006) and <em>Haskalah: The Romantic Movement in Judaism</em> (Rut
 gers UP\, 2012). Professor Litvak is currently writing a book about the 
 origins of Zionism in imperial Russia.&#160\;</p>

 \n<p>The geriatric population is prescribed the highest proportion of me

 his number will increase to 50% by 2040. Prevalence of both adverse drug
  reactions and treatment failures increase in the older patients. Advers
 e Drug Events (ADEs) are responsible for 5-28% of acute geriatric medica
 l admissions. It has been estimated that for every one dollar we spend o
 n medications at nursing home facilities\, we spend $1.33 in health care
  resources for the treatment of drug related morbidity and mortality. In
  this review we will talk about the drug mechanism\, why some people are
  able to tolerate some medications and why some others not\, what we can
  do to change the nature of practice of medicine in the future and how w
 e can provide more safety for us when we age.</p>\n<p>Speaker: <strong>M
